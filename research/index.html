<h2 id="1--solid-thin-film-growth">1.  Solid thin film growth</h2>
<p>Epitaxial growth is a process in which adatoms are deposited on a substrate and grow a solid thin film on the substrate. Epitaxial growth on crystal surface involves various structures, one of which is described by step flow dynamics driven by misfit elasticity between thin film and the substrate.</p>
<p>The discrete Burton-Cabrera-Frank (BCF) type models have been proposed by Burton, Cabrera, Frank, Duport, Tersoff, et al.. From the macroscopic view, the governing equations for thin film grow processes are all 4th order degenerate parabolic equations. We focus on the analytic validation of those continuum models by studying the continuum limit from discrete model, global positive solution, strong solutions with latent singularities and long-time behavior of solutions. The detailed evolution of boundary profiles such like facets is still open.</p>

<h2 id="2-tear-film-evolution">2. Tear film evolution</h2>
<p>Fluid thin film is offten more complicated than solid thin film. A spatial variation in a thin lipid layer leads to locally elevated evaporation rates of the tear film, which in turn affects the local salt concentration in the liquid film. After considering all the contributions from evaporation, capillarity and osmolarity, a general model to capture and explore the key features of tear-film dynamics and rupture with power-law mobility functions is investigated.</p>

<h2 id="3-exact-controllability-and-stabilization-in-porous-materials">3. Exact controllability and stabilization in porous materials</h2>
<p>My research interests also extend to noise control in building materials which derives a system of wave equation coupled with some acoustic boundary conditions. Although there has been some research on system with acoustic boundary condition, there is little result dealing with completely nonlinear oscillatory of boundary materials, especially for uniformly stabilization with only boundary damping.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-motion-of-defects-in-materials-science-including-dislocations-and-grain-boundaries">4. Motion of defects in materials science including dislocations and grain boundaries</h2>
<p>Dislocations are line defects in crystalline materials and they play essential roles in understanding materials properties like plastic deformation and in the development of novel materials with robust performance.</p>
<p>The detailed structure in a dislocation core can be described by the Peierls-Nabarro (PN) model, which is a multiscale continuum model that incorporates the atomistic effect by introducing a nonlinear potential describing the nonlinear atomistic interaction across the slip plane of the dislocation. We focus on existence, De Giorgi-type 1D symmetry, uniqueness and asymptotic stability of the original 3D vectorial dislocation model.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-numerical-analysis-for-contact-line-dynamics">5. Numerical analysis for contact line dynamics</h2>
<p>The dynamics and equilibrium of a droplet on a substrate are important problems with many practical applications such as coating, painting in industries and the adhesion of vesicles in biotechnology. Particularly, the contact line dynamics of a droplet placed on a rough inclined surface are challenging fluid mechanics problems dated back to Young in 1805. The capillary effect, which contributes the leading behaviors of the geometric motion of a small droplet, is characterized by the surface tensions on interfaces separating two different physical phases.</p>
<p>The geometric dynamics of the droplets are described by the mean curvature flow of the capillary surface, coupled with the moving contact lines (where three phases meet), which contributes the leading driven force for the droplet dynamics. The dynamic contact angles tend to go to the equilibrium contact angle (Young&rsquo;s angle) following the contact line speed mechanism proposed by de Gennes. We focus on the 2nd order unconditionally stable numerical schemes for simulating droplets dynamics on a inclined rough surface with topological changes.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-applied-stochastic-analysis">6. Applied stochastic analysis</h2>
<p>PDEs modeling macroscopic dynamics in equilibrium/non-equilibrium systems are usually guided by the underlying competing mechanism at the microscopic level. Meanwhile, an effective description of the microscopic dynamics, using equilibrium Gibbs measure or non-equilibrium optimal twist measure, is suggested by macroscopic observations.</p>
<p>We first focused on deriving the continuum limit PDE from the Markov jumping process on lattice. Then for Markov process on point clouds, which suggest an approximated intrinsic manifold (for instance by diffusion map), we simulate the Fokker-Planck equation on the manifold by constructing an approximate Voronoi tessellation. The constructed Markov process (with transition probability assigned on each adjacent data points) and the approximated energy landscape are foundations to simulate inbetweening transformations and manifold-related sampling/transition path problems in biochemical reactions.</p>
